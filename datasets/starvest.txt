What is the primary investment focus of Starvest plc?
Greatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in Australia. Havieron’s initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent to 6.5M oz gold equivalent during the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered operational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not uncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.

What is the investment strategy of Starvest plc?
The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target companies in the natural resources sector, which the Board sees as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were generally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket. The Company may also take direct interests in mining projects and subsequently acquire equity positions in target companies on favorable terms in exchange for these direct project interests. Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000, though total investments may exceed this after further funding support.

The Company limits the total size of any single commitment to mitigate risk.
